# Survival Game Concept
**Intro**

This is a medium-high level Prototype of a Unreal Engine v5 Game Completely done mainly in C++,C, & C#. In this protoype it's a proof of concept of the basic mechanics of a survival game. It includes: Eating, Harvesting trees, Mining Rocks, Other creatures, Health, Stamina, Hunger, Inventory system, & A building system with even more to discover. The level uses Unreal Engine v5 landscaping tools to create a simple level that could be added upon if wanted too.

**Gameplay Implemented**

Most of the game was done completely in some form of C or C++ or C# Here is the mechanics done in these: 
- Player Camera
- Player Movement
- Building Mechanics
- Item Rotating
- Tree resources
- Rock resources
- Berry resource
- Objectives
- Player Inventory 
- Player Jumping

I also used some blue prints to handle the simpler things in the engine for instance these: 
- Huds
- Player Stats
- GUI

**How To Play**

The game is currently in a sandbox state. Where your Objectives are displayed on the top right of the screen to give you direction. Your Main goal is to build a small house using 5 pieces. As well as collect 500 materials before your hunger goes down to 0 and you lose all your health. 

The main gameplay loop will be harvest resources. Enter your Inventory Menu and eat the berries collected or create buildings you can later place.

**How It Can Be Exapanded**

The game could easily be woven into any Survival game as the ground work is already laid out and requires minimal effort to create new resources. Here however are some things you could do to expand the game:

- Replacing Programmer Art

  This allows for the game to look more polished.
- Create more building types

  This gives the player more insentive to find other materials.

- Adding Enemies

  Adding a way for a player to lose health aside from eating will be perfect to go along with the fact as eating allows the player to gain health.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: "How do I Collect resources?"
A: Walk close to the item to where it's most of your screen then press the Ineteract Button 

Q: "Why Post this open source?" 
A: I believe a good programmer should have code anyone can understand if they look at the source. With this project I wanted other to look at the code I created as it is neat and completely commented for easy documentation. I also wanted to demostrate that this game was mainly done using only C coding lanuages

Q: "What do the other people do?" 
A: Nothing as of currently. They are a proof of concept of animals that could be running around as the player collects resources as well as other surivalist. 

Q: "I can't interact with Menus when I press F"
A: "This is by design. I wanted to create a menu system like runescape where you can walk and glance into your inventory while walking. Left click when bringing it up and it will lock your cursor onto that window.
